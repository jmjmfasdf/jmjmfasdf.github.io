## Greetings!

Thank you for visiting my personal space, where I archive my academic journey and personal endeavors. This blog serves as a repository of my thoughts, research, and insights as I explore the fascinating intersections of science and technology.

I am currently passionate about Artificial Intelligence (with a particular focus on Reinforcement Learning) and Computational Neuroscience. My academic background is rooted in Biotechnology, as I completed my Bachelor’s degree at Yonsei University, where I also pursued an AI-integrated course.

One of my greatest aspirations is to uncover the origins of human intelligence. The human mind, often likened to 'starlight'—a source of power and wonder—can be approached through various scientific and philosophical lenses. Among these, I am particularly inspired by the potential of neural networks to "imitate" and "decode" brain activity, bridging the gap between biological processes and computational models.

I wish this blog to be precious record for peliminary investigators who love to dive in their interests.

Best wishes,
Jeongmin Seo. November 2024.

## 인사말

제 블로그를 방문해 주셔서 감사합니다.

앞으로 석사, 박사 과정을 밟음에 있어서 일어나는 일들을 기록해보려고 합니다.
인공지능을 이용한 뇌의 결정, 그리고 전략적인 사고 과정 연구가 메인 주제가 될 것 같은데, 앞으로 배워 나가는 대로 기록해 보도록 하겠습니다.
뇌와 인공지능을 좋아하는 사람들에게 보탬이 되었으면 좋겠습니다.

감사합니다.
