# Introduction

<br>

# Functional MRI

<br>

# Representational similarity analysis (RSA)

<br>

# What is representation?

## From mental content to neural representation: a proposal

<br>


# What does RSA tell us about neural representation?

<br>

# Provisional representations: What doesnâ€™t RSA tell us

<br>

# Representations in psychology

<br>

# Conclusion

    <figcaption>figure 1. (A) First order RSA: Differences between patterns of activity in a chunk of tissue responding to two objects, here a hand and an umbrella, populate once cell of an RDM in (B). (B) A complete RDM can now be compared using second order RSA with other RDMs constructed from behavior, input measures, or other models.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>figure 2. Comparing RDMs through second-order RSA can relate representational geometries across very different methods, whereas direct relationships can be difficult to establish</figcaption>
